## AddSubviewDemo

This is an demonstration of adding an array of subviews in Swift 3.

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44816254/programmatically-create-an-array-of-objects-swift-3.

This was developed in Swift 3 on Xcode 8.3.3 for iOS 10. But, the basic ideas are equally applicable for different versions of Swift and/or Objective-C. The use of presentation controller requires iOS 8 or later.
